The 'html' request field accepts a string. If the code for your website will be longer than reasonable, you must still try to write and send the request. If your website is complete (that is, it contains the </html> closing tag), the plugin will create a temporary web page and return the URL to access it. If your website is incomplete (that is, the </html> tag is missing), the API responds with a token that you must use to continue your code. When a web page is created successfully, the page is deleted about two minutes after the first time it's accessed. If the page is never accessed, it is automatically deleted after about ten minutes.",
